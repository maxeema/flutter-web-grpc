# flutter-web-grpc sample

<b>Flutter Web gRPC sample</b> (Dart gRPC-backend, Flutter Web front-end)

<h3>Problem (still reproduces on Flutter 3.19.4)</h3>
In Flutter Web app normal gRPC calls fails when interract directly with a gRPC server. To make it work we will use Envoy.

<h3>About the repo</h3>
A sample of a Flutter Web app that utilizes the "grpc" packages from pub.dev.
We will use a proxy called Envoy, that makes gRPC calls work from Flutter Web app.
<br/><br/>
Note: The samples work on localhost without authentication.
So, instead of direct calls to a gRPC server we will communicate with it via Envoy like this: Flutter Web App - Envoy - gRPC server. For Flutter native, mobile or cli-Dart apps we don't need Envoy.

<h3>About my Runtime - Linux</h3>
This sample I wrote and tested on Ubuntu 20.04.4 LTS

<h3>Requirements</h3>
Flutter 3.19.4<br/>
Dart SDK version: 3.3.2 (stable)<br/>
Envoy 1.18.2<br/>

<h3>Optional Requirements:</h3>
libprotoc 26.0

### Proto sources
Located at the "protos/" dir.

### Compiled protos
Located at the "shared/src/generated/protos/" dir compiled by "protoc" (libprotoc 26.0).

<h3>1. Run the gRPC server (in our sample it is a Dart gRPC server)</h3>

It will bind localhost:50051 (see envoy.yaml for the configuration)

> cd dart_server_grpc_demo/

> dart pub get

> dart bin/dart_server_grpc_demo.dart

<h3>2. Run Envoy (a proxy that makes gRPC Web calls work)</h3>

It will bind localhost:50052 and communicate with gRPC server at localhost:50051 (see envoy.yaml for the configuration)

> envoy -c envoy.yaml

<h3>3. Run the web app and ensure gRPC calls works</h3>

Afer run, click "Refresh" button at the right bottom corner to call gRPC and the result will appear at the center of the screen.
<br/><br/>
You should see *Hello, flutter 1! after next click *Hello, flutter 2!*, etc.

> cd flutter_web_client_grpc_demo_app/

> flutter run -d chrome

<h3>Run the cli Dart app (optionally)</h3>

The cli Dart app works well with a direct gRPC server, as well as via Envoy.
<br/><br/>
You should see the output: *Greeter client received: Hello, dart!*

> cd dart_client_grpc_demo/

> dart pub get

> dart bin/dart_client_grpc_demo.dart
